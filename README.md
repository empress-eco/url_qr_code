- QR Code. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode">here</a> for more details.

### Installation
To install Empress PibiCut, clone the repository using this [link](https://github.com/empress-eco/url_qr_code.git) and then execute the following commands from the Empress-bench folder:

```sh
$ bench get-app pibicut https://github.com/empress-eco/url_qr_code.git
$ bench install-app pibicut
```
For a multi-tenant environment, use the following command
```sh
$ bench --site site_name install-app pibicut

## Usage
Upon installation, a new doctype 'Shortener' is generated. Search for the 'Shortener' Doctype to view and create shortened URLs. When accessed, the resulting shortened URL redirects to the long URL, as does scanning the generated QR Code.
